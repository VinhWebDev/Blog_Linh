            - After 18 years of living a life encapsulated in 3 uniforms from primary to high school, the day I got
            to the
            doorstep of FPT University was the day I walked through my safety zone and discovered that " With
            knowledge
            of
            books, I absolutely cannot learn anything".I still remember that I came to Hanoi with the desire to
            learned,
            improved myself, and became successful. But then I realized, "Before learning something yourself, learn
            to
            love
            yourself." </p>

            <p> - Born and raised in a coastal city of Quang Ninh, but now Hanoi is my home. Hanoi never sleeps, never
                gets
                tired,
                never gets old. I send Hanoi my dreams and ambitions. Hanoi sends me many good friends who go through my
                life
                and gift me with unforgettable impressions. Hanoi also does not forget to take away its "The person who
                used
                to
                love", who is used to consider everything.</p>
            <p>- I have a close friend who is from Hanoi, who has been close for 3 years of high school. This friend is
                the
                "person who used to love" I just mentioned, after 2 months of love, I fall apart for the stupid reason
                of
                age.
                â€œ19-year-olds choose love or career ''. And 19 years old is my most useless time, instead of spending
                time
                chasing my ambitions, I follow people who don't want to follow me.</p>
            <p>- "During the days of being friends with the Sun, I gathered sunlight to sell, hoping to buy something to
                buy
                the
                Rain " and through the hustle and bustle of August, Hanoi sent me my 20th birthday present. "- the one
                who
                works
                with me to fulfill my promises is the most meaningful birthday gift that Hanoi gives me. Since then, I
                have
                not
                been alone on my way of self-discovery at the age of 20. He is also an endless source of energy to help
                me
                successfully complete my own projects.</p>

            <p>- The journey to the age of 21 is a very long journey to tell, but I love the feeling that I am living
                all that
                I
                have, and my blog was born simply to share with you about it. with my journey of changing the behavior
                of
                buying
                super silly items.</p>
