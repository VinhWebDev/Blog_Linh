                        Have you ever wondered how much clothes you wear today cost? Does it really suit you? Why do the
                        same clothes that other people wear look so beautiful and fashionable while it doesn't work for
                        you?<br><br>
                        If the article is helpful to you, it may also be helpful to others, sharing is
                        caring!<br><br><br>

                        <h4>SHOPPING IS NOT ONLY BUY THING, BUT ALSO " BUY CONFIDENT".</h4>

                        Everyone has their own signature that makes them feel most confident about themselves. Why do I
                        mention "confidence" and not "happiness"? Because confidence leads to happiness. Does your
                        fashion
                        sense make you confident at the moment?<br><br>

                        Just now, because over time these things will change. For the uncle who sells lottery tickets,
                        clean, not tattered, not dirty clothes will make him confident. For me, as a student, a white
                        T-shirt and jeans mixed with sneakers will make me confident. For a certain model, buying the
                        most
                        outstanding gorgeous dress will make her confident. For a mother, buying clothes that make her
                        children proud when she wears them will make her feel confident. And for a lot of people,
                        wearing
                        designer clothing makes them feel confident.<br><br>

                        The guy selling lottery tickets did not need the clothes of that model. The other mother can't
                        wear
                        a student suit like me. For example, you can see that everyone has a different way of thinking
                        about
                        a fashion self concept, a different value system that cannot be measured by money. Money can
                        only
                        reflect the price of the product, not the level of happiness it gives the buyer.<br><br>
                        It is not that I disparage the brand or I want to show that I am a fairy in heaven and that
                        material
                        is ephemeral. When I was in the first year of college,I went to the shopping mall to buy
                        brand-name
                        clothes. But after having had certain experiences, those things did not bring me joy. With money
                        in
                        hand, now I like to invest, travel, take care of family and new experiences. Those are the
                        things
                        that make me happy. 100% respectful of people who find joy in wearing designer clothing, not
                        unlike
                        people who find joy in collecting antiques, playing cars or updating tech. The difference in
                        that
                        value system is the beauty that makes this life more colorful.<br><br><br>
                        <h4> DO YOU WONDER,WHY YOU STILL GGLY WHILE WEARING BRAND-CLOTHES?</h4>
                        Because ugly/beautiful depends on personal preferences, cultural fonts and tastes of each
                        person,
                        money is irrelevant, people can spending spree,it’s not my business. I find it really terrible
                        when
                        every year, every time Vietnam Fashion Week, appears full of cursing comments on people dressed
                        differently. The main difference in art, the rebellion of youth will lead to great things ahead.
                        In
                        a full-color rainbow picture there will be colors you like and dislike, but living in a rainbow
                        painting is still more fun than living in a picture with only the "right" gray?<br><br><br>

                        And here is the answer of the question, I promise it will be very helpful to you.<br>
                        If you choose answer A: You are a very simple person, you do not have too high requirements on
                        designs, materials, prices of pants.<br>
                        If you choose answer B: You are also quite meticulous when choosing clothes and choosing your
                        fashion style. You like to wear clothes that are applicable and durable, such as being able to
                        wear
                        to work and hang out. Please regularly review the review before buying so that you can choose
                        the
                        best clothes to avoid "Money loss, disability"!<br>
                        If you choose answer C: You are a person who likes to spread the spirit of community. You do not
                        like to dress differently at the group or workplace. You are very loyal to the fashion brands
                        you
                        use often. So increase the uniforms, group shirts with your family, the clubs you join in the
                        closet
                        so that when you go out, you won't feel like there's nothing to wear anymore.
                        <br>If you choose answer D: You are a person with a passion, a strong desire to express
                        yourself.
                        You
                        always want to be the center of the universe and people respect you. Use that as an incentive to
                        make a lot of money to buy for yourself the collections of famous fashion brands, personal
                        branding
                        clothes.<br>

                        everyone
                        wants to come. You just live as yourself, wear what you like, feel comfortable, regardless of
                        other
                        people's thoughts.
