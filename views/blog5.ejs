                        It was nearly 1 o'clock at night but I still can't sleep. Just keep surfing the web and it's
                        filled with 3.3 Shopee's sale ads, making me think of my memorable purchase at Shopee. I wonder
                        how many times you have bought the half-baked stuff on the internet like me, then let me know by
                        leaving a comment below.<br><br>

                        Products are an expression of social status, looking at celebrities who use the famous cosmetic
                        brands that make me always want to one day own those items. But because I'm just a college
                        student with an unstable income source, I chose to buy the L'Oreal Paris products. It is a
                        cosmetic company run by my idol, Lan Khue, a KOL, so I was quite impressed with that cosmetic
                        company. Through MKT201, I learned that L'Oreal Paris had hired Lan Khue to represent the media
                        to create faith for customers, but Lan Khue was not a loyal customer of L'Oreal Paris from the
                        beginning. It's too rambling and what you probably want to know most is that I bought a full set
                        of skincare from that company for 2 million VND because I saw the words "50% sale off", but when
                        the payment is completed and put into use, turns out it's fake.<br><br>

                        I cried because all my savings vaporizing away with the package I gleefully waiting to be
                        received after 4 days. And I laughed (bitter laugh) when I received the feedback from the shop
                        "Good luck next time =))".<br><br>

                        <h4>PEOPLE OFTEN THINK THAT SHOPEE’S PRODUCTS WILL BE MANAGED AND CHECKED CAREFULLY.</h4>
                        <img src="https://tipsmake.com/data/images/purchase-experience-on-shopee-to-avoid-buying-fake-goods-picture-2-AGfIySiAH.jpg"
                            alt="" srcset=""><br><br>
                        It is a very popular question that shops respond to their customers when asked about product
                        quality" but I want to emphasize that "The new trend of online buying has boomed in Vietnam
                        since th Covid epidemic, so quality management, as well as the policy of protecting the
                        interests of Shopee customers as well as the law, cannot be guaranteed" <br><br>
                        So that,you should refer to some of the following Shopee shopping tips:<br>
                        1. Immediately say "No" to shops with poor product quality assessment, incorrect sample
                        delivery, reply to messages too slow.<br>
                        2. Not every shop with a 5-star rating is also good: If you find that the shop is rated as "good
                        service", "fast delivery" ... then it is just professionalism, not evaluation product. Sometimes
                        buyers, in this case, can not distinguish between the real or the fake.<br>
                        3. Choose golden days, golden hours to hunt for Shopee sales to buy your favorite products at
                        discounted prices.<br>
                        4. It is recommended to buy products for health usage, high-end products at Shopee malls
                        (verified shop or by Shopee itself), or official websites to avoid buying fake, bad quality
                        products.
