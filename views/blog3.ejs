                        <h4>1. COMPLEX BUYING BEHAVIOR</h4>
                        I usually buy valuable items based on this behavior. For example, buying shares of a certain
                        company, or buying phones, laptops. The first thing is that I have to go to all websites to find
                        information, compare the prices between sellers. Then go to Youtube, watch experts analyze the
                        advantages and disadvantages of the product you buy. And finally, join groups about that type of
                        product or read product reviews from customers knowing their experiences with the product before
                        deciding to buy it. So if you are a marketer, you need to be patient, provide customers like me
                        with all the information about your product, thoroughly analyze the aspects of the product to
                        provide the customer with good experiences. Then you can sell your product successfully.<br><br>
                        <br><br>
                        <h4>2. VARIETY-SEEKING BUYING BEHAVIOR</h4>
                        Sometimes I also buy products of medium or low value follow this behavior. For example fabric
                        softener, pen or mask... A product with the same usage, but I will buy different types,
                        different brands. Not that I am disloyal to those products, but I simply like to discover new
                        features of different types of products, or I simply just want to change sometimes. When meeting
                        customers with this habit of buying things, to minimize the "change preference" of customers,
                        marketers should focus on the shelves, present in all distribution channels to create
                        convenience for customers, thereby reducing brand comparison, gradually pushing them to buy more
                        habitually. On the contrary, competitors can prevent this by offering discounts, promotions at
                        the point of sale, creating new value, attractive reasons to have customers' attention. <br><br>
                        <h4>3. HABITUAL BUYING BEHAVIOR</h4>
                        I often use this while buying personal belongings. For example, cosmetics are always by L'oreal
                        Paris, toothpaste by P/S, or Thai pro detergent powder. I usually do not take too much time and
                        effort to decide on choosing these products. Just simply use it up, then buy it. When I have a
                        lot of money or have a promotion, I will buy a large size and capacity. But if I don't have too
                        much money, that's fine, just buy enough to use then. Therefore, if you are a marketer and
                        reading this article you should create point-of-sale promotions to "pull" customers like me to
                        buy products from you. Or adjust products' prices, create the difference to attract customers.
                        <br><br>
                        <h4>4. DISSONANCE-REDUCING BUYING BEHAVIOR</h4>
                        Have you ever gone through the process of searching and refining information about products but
                        it is very difficult to feel the difference between each brand you choose to buy? Therefore,
                        customers often turn to the decision to buy somewhere convenient or affordable. For example, I
                        am a fan of washing hair to relieve stress. Whenever I'm tired or want to wash my hair, I always
                        choose the nearest salon or the one with not too many customers, so sometimes I end up in some
                        awkward situations: some salon with poor quality and service but the cost just too high. So if
                        you are selling products and providing services like that, you need to increase customer faith,
                        help them reduce anxiety when buying a product that is not satisfactory by giving it a trial, or
                        enthusiastic advice, thorough warranty, guarantee for customers when buying the product from
                        you.
